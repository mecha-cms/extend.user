### File

What you need to do after installing this extension is simply to make a page file in `lot\user` folder and name it as you like. The page file name then can be treated as the user name. For example, here I want to make a user file named as `@ta-tau-taufik`:

~~~ .txt
.\
 └── lot\
     └── user\
         └── ta-tau-taufik.page
~~~

And here is the content of `ta-tau-taufik.page` file:

~~~ .yaml
---
$: Taufik Nurrohman
type: Markdown
status: 1
...

I am the main author of [this site](%{url}%).
~~~

### Page

User page is accessible through `%{url}%/user/{$key}` where `{$key}` is the user key/name without the `@` prefix. Example:

~~~ .txt
%{url}%/user/ta-tau-taufik
~~~

To go to the log in page, remove the user key/name part from URL:

~~~ .txt
%{url}%/user
~~~

> **Note:** If `lot\user\ta-tau-taufik\pass.data` file does not exist, then the password field will function as a password generator. You can type any password in it and `pass.data` file will be created automatically.

### Constant

This extension automatically adds a `user` folder within the `lot` folder, which will also automatically set a new constant based on the folder name with a value of the folder path:

~~~ .php
USER
~~~

### Method

There are some methods added to the default [classes][link:../class]:

#### Is → User

~~~ .xmp.php
Is::user($key = null, $fail = false);
~~~

**Example:**

Check whether a user is logged in:

~~~ .php
if (Is::user()) { … }
~~~

Check whether user `@ta-tau-taufik` is logged in:

~~~ .php
if (Is::user('ta-tau-taufik')) { … }
~~~

#### Get → Users

~~~ .xmp.php
Get::users($folder = USER, …, $sort = [1, 'slug'], …);
~~~

Arguments are the same with [`Get::pages()`][link:../class/get/pages], except the `$folder` parameter that uses `USER` [constant][link:../constant] value by default, and the `$sort` parameter that uses `slug` as the default sort key instead of `time`.
